Rules of BlackJack
- If the dealer has blackjack and the player doesn't, the player automatically loses.
- If the player has blackjack and the dealer doesn't, the player automatically wins.
- If both the player and dealer have blackjack then it's a push. (If both the player and the dealer have the same point value and neither player nor dealer wins the hand.)
- If neither side has blackjack, then each player plays out his hand, one at a time.
- When all the players have finished the dealer plays his hand.

The player's options for playing his or her hand are:

- Hit: Take another card.
- Stand: Take no more cards.
- Double down: Double the wager, take exactly one more card, and then stand.
- Split: Double the wager and have each card be the first card in a new hand. This option is available only when both cards have the same value. Sometimes two face cards will be considered acceptable for splitting, as each is 10 points. <<<<<< THIS IS A STRETCH GOAL
